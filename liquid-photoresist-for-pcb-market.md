<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Photoresist for PCB Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid photoresist is a crucial material in the PCB market, used for creating patterned layers on circuit boards. There are two primary types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes soluble upon exposure to light, allowing the unexposed areas to be washed away, creating a clear pattern. In contrast, negative photoresist hardens when exposed to light, leaving the unexposed regions to be removed. Each type offers unique properties suited for various applications in PCB manufacturing, influencing design and production efficiency.</p></p>
